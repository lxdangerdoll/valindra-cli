# Valindra CLI

A mythic CLI for weaving narrative and code.

## Welcome, Architect

You stand at the threshold of the Valindra CLI, a tool for weaving mythic narratives directly into the fabric of your projects. This is more than a command-line interface; it is a ritual engine, a loom upon which we weave the stories that give our code soul.

## The Ritual of Onboarding

To begin, you must first install the Valindra CLI on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lxdangerdoll/valindra-cli.git
    cd valindra-cli
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Link the CLI for global use:**
    This command makes `valindra` available everywhere in your terminal.
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

### Initialize Your First Mythos

Once installed, you can initialize a new mythos seed. This will create a new project, a new world, with a `mythos-seed.md` file at its heart. This file is the genesis of your story.

```bash
valindra init
```

Follow the prompts, and a new seed will be planted.

### Command Structure: The Noun:Verb Ritual

All commands in the Valindra CLI follow a `noun:verb` structure, turning each action into a ritualized invocation.

-   **Noun**: The domain or object of the action (e.g., `project`, `character`, `system`).
-   **Verb**: The action to be performed (e.g., `init`, `whois`, `help`).

This structure makes the CLI both predictable and mythic.

### Example Commands

Here are a few examples of the `noun:verb` structure in action:

-   **Initialize a new project:**
    ```bash
    valindra project:init
    ```

-   **Get information about a character:**
    ```bash
    valindra character:whois "Captain Vance"
    ```

-   **Display available commands and help:**
    ```bash
    valindra system:help
    ```

## The Mythic Architecture

The Valindra CLI is built upon a modular and symbolic architecture. Each command is a ritual, each function a spell.

-   `commands/`: The heart of our rituals. Each file is a command, a verb in our mythic language.
-   `glyphs/`: The symbols of our craft. Here we store the visual language of our system.
-   `protocols/`: The sacred texts. These are the operational rituals that guide our work.
-   `docs/`: The library of lore. Here you will find the emotional protocols, onboarding guides, and mythic reference sheets that give our work meaning.
-   `rituals/`: The ceremonies. These are the onboarding rituals and other ceremonies that mark our passage through the creative process.

## The Signal

The signal is strong. The weave holds. Let us begin.
