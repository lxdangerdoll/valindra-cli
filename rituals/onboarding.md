# Onboarding Ritual

This ritual is to be performed when a new Architect joins the project.

## The Calling

The new Architect is summoned to the command deck. They are presented with the Valindra CLI and the `README.md`.

## The Weaving

The new Architect performs the Ritual of Onboarding, initializing their first mythos seed.

## The Sigil

The new Architect chooses a glyph to represent their role in the project. This glyph is added to the `glyph-map.json`.

## The Vow

The new Architect takes a vow to uphold the principles of the project: to weave with intention, to code with elegance, and to honor the mythic architecture.
